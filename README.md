## Application

A hangman word-guess game in the style of the 90's takes input from user key strokes.

The application will register input and then determine if:
-The letter is included in the mystery word, causing the letter to appear in the blanks of the mystery word
-The letter is not included in the mystery word, causing a decrease in guesses left and placing the letter in the bank

If the user wins, "wins" increases by one point and plays a victory song

If the user loses, "losses" increases by one point and plays a loss song

The user will have the option to "play again" and continue to register wins and losses.
